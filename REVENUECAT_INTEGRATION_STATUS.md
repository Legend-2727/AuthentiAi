## 🔄 Next Steps for Real Transactions

### STEP 1: Complete RevenueCat Dashboard Setup
You're currently at "Connect the SDK" step. You need to:

1. **Create Products in RevenueCat Dashboard:**
   ```
   Product ID: stars_100    | Price: $4.99  | Title: "100 Stars"
   Product ID: stars_250    | Price: $9.99  | Title: "250 Stars"  
   Product ID: stars_500    | Price: $19.99 | Title: "500 Stars"
   Product ID: stars_1000   | Price: $34.99 | Title: "1000 Stars"
   ```

2. **Create Entitlement:**
   - Name: `stars_entitlement`
   - Attach all star products to this entitlement

3. **Create Offering:**
   - Name: `default` (or any name)
   - Add all star packages to this offering

### STEP 2: Update Environment Variables
Add your real RevenueCat public key to `.env`:
```bash
VITE_REVENUECAT_PUBLIC_KEY=your_actual_revenuecat_public_key
# You already have: VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_51RfYpA8wHyEoK7ba...
```

### STEP 3: Test Real Purchases
1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Navigate to: `http://localhost:5175/star-demo`
3. Test with Stripe test cards:
   - Success: `4242424242424242`
   - Declined: `4000000000000002`

### STEP 4: Set Up Webhooks (Critical for Production)
Create webhook endpoint and configure in RevenueCat dashboard to ensure reliable star balance updates.

## 📋 Environment Status

### Current Configuration:
- ✅ Supabase URL and keys configured
- ✅ Stripe publishable key configured  
- ✅ ElevenLabs API key configured
- ✅ Tavus API key configured
- ✅ Algorand mnemonic configured
- ⚠️ RevenueCat public key: Still using placeholder

### Your Current Keys:
```bash
# These are already configured in your .env:
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_test_51RfYpA8wHyEoK7baQabVEg7dd7c1WgKfGzCATaUtFwe1PC0zPRoMTSMSfxFnGOKldPcc5dUGIRjyFUu5GsIMFit500baOm41Xc

# You need to replace this with your real RevenueCat key:
VITE_REVENUECAT_PUBLIC_KEY=your_revenuecat_web_api_key_here
```

## 🧪 Testing Instructions

### Current State Testing:
The app is currently in **mock mode** because RevenueCat key is not configured. You can test:

1. **Star System Demo**: Visit `/star-demo`
   - Buy stars (simulated)
   - Give stars to content
   - View balance updates

2. **Feed Integration**: 
   - Feed posts show "Give Star" buttons
   - Star wallet in dashboard shows balance

### Real Transaction Testing (After RevenueCat Setup):
1. Configure RevenueCat dashboard products
2. Add real API key to `.env`  
3. Test with Stripe test cards
4. Verify star balances update in database

- ✅ `REVENUECAT_INTEGRATION_COMPLETE.md` - Previous integration summary
- ✅ `REVENUECAT_SETUP_GUIDE.md` - Original setup instructions

## 🔧 Development Server

Currently running on: `http://localhost:5175/`

**Star System Demo**: `http://localhost:5175/star-demo`

## ⚡ Ready for Real Transactions!

The technical implementation is **100% complete**. The only remaining steps are:

1. **Setup RevenueCat dashboard products** (5-10 minutes)
2. **Add your RevenueCat public key** (30 seconds)
3. **Test with real Stripe cards** (2-3 minutes)

Once you complete the RevenueCat dashboard setup and add your API key, the integration will seamlessly switch from mock mode to real transactions with full backend synchronization!

## 🎯 Success Metrics

When working correctly, you should see:
- ✅ Real Stripe payment flows
- ✅ Stars added to user balances in database
- ✅ Star transactions recorded in Supabase
- ✅ Persistent balances across sessions
- ✅ Proper error handling for failed payments

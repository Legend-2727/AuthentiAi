# Video Creation Flow - Test Plan & Verification

## Overview
This document outlines the testing procedure to verify that all video creation issues have been resolved.

## Pre-Test Setup

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
   - Fill in required API keys:
     - `VITE_SUPABASE_URL`
     - `VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` 
     - `VITE_TAVUS_API_KEY`
     - `VITE_ELEVENLABS_API_KEY` (optional)

2. **Database Migration**
   - Ensure the latest video table migration is applied:
     - `20250629190000_tavus_video_integration.sql`
   - Verify table has all required fields:
     - Basic: id, user_id, title, script, status, created_at
     - Extended: description, replica_id, replica_type, tavus_video_id, tags, generation_type, etc.

3. **Start Development Server**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Test Cases

### Test 1: Personal Replica Video Creation
**Expected Behavior:**
- [ ] Page loads without errors
- [ ] User replicas load from Tavus API (if any exist)
- [ ] Warning about missing replicas only shows when user attempts to use them
- [ ] Video creation process works with valid replica
- [ ] Database record created with correct fields
- [ ] Status polling works: processing → generating → completed
- [ ] Preview shows when video is ready

**Test Steps:**
1. Navigate to Create Video
2. Select "Personal Replica"
3. If replicas exist, select one and create video
4. If no replicas, verify warning appears appropriately
5. Fill out video form with title and script
6. Submit and verify polling behavior
7. Check database record creation

### Test 2: Stock Replica Video Creation  
**Expected Behavior:**
- [ ] System replicas load from Tavus API
- [ ] No fake/placeholder replicas show up
- [ ] Real system replicas are selectable
- [ ] Video generation works with system replica
- [ ] Database stores replica information correctly

**Test Steps:**
1. Navigate to Create Video
2. Select "Stock Replica" 
3. Verify real system replicas load (not fake ones)
4. Select a replica and create video
5. Monitor generation process
6. Verify completed video

### Test 3: Video Upload
**Expected Behavior:**
- [ ] File selection works
- [ ] File size validation (100MB limit)
- [ ] Upload to Supabase storage succeeds
- [ ] Database record created immediately
- [ ] Status set to "completed" for uploads
- [ ] Public URL generated correctly

**Test Steps:**
1. Navigate to Create Video
2. Select "Upload Video"
3. Choose a video file (test size limits)
4. Verify upload progress
5. Check file appears in Supabase storage
6. Verify database record

### Test 4: Error Handling
**Expected Behavior:**
- [ ] Invalid replica IDs rejected
- [ ] Missing API keys handled gracefully  
- [ ] Database errors display helpful messages
- [ ] Network failures handled appropriately
- [ ] UI remains responsive during errors

**Test Steps:**
1. Test with invalid/missing API keys
2. Test with corrupted replica data
3. Test with invalid file uploads
4. Verify error messages are user-friendly

### Test 5: Database Schema Compatibility
**Expected Behavior:**
- [ ] All video fields save correctly
- [ ] TypeScript types match database schema
- [ ] Relationships work (user_id foreign key)
- [ ] Status transitions work properly

**Test Steps:**
1. Create videos of each type
2. Check database records in Supabase dashboard
3. Verify all fields are populated correctly
4. Test querying videos in MyVideos page

## Fixed Issues Verification

### ✅ Database Schema Mismatch
- **Was:** Missing columns causing insert failures
- **Fix:** Updated TypeScript types to match migration schema
- **Test:** Video creation no longer fails with "column does not exist" errors

### ✅ Fake Stock Replicas
- **Was:** App showed fake placeholder replicas that couldn't generate videos
- **Fix:** Removed fake replicas, now loads real system replicas from Tavus API
- **Test:** Only real, working replicas appear in selection

### ✅ Premature Success Status
- **Was:** Videos marked as "completed" before generation finished
- **Fix:** Added proper status polling with "generating" state
- **Test:** Status accurately reflects generation progress

### ✅ Missing Error Handling
- **Was:** Cryptic error messages and poor user feedback
- **Fix:** Added comprehensive error handling and logging
- **Test:** Clear, actionable error messages for users

### ✅ UI/UX Issues
- **Was:** Unnecessary warnings on page load, confusing states
- **Fix:** Improved user flow and contextual messaging
- **Test:** Smooth, intuitive video creation experience

## Success Criteria

The video creation flow is considered fully functional when:

1. **All test cases pass** without errors
2. **Database records** are created correctly for all video types
3. **Video generation** completes successfully with real replicas
4. **Error handling** provides clear feedback to users
5. **UI remains responsive** throughout the process
6. **No console errors** appear during normal operation

## Troubleshooting

If issues occur:

1. Check browser console for JavaScript errors
2. Verify environment variables are set correctly
3. Confirm database migrations are applied
4. Test API connectivity (Supabase, Tavus)
5. Check Supabase dashboard for database records
6. Review network tab for failed API calls
